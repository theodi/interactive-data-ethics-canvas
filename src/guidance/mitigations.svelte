There are many steps that can be taken to minimise negative impacts, from collecting a wider variety of data, to increasing transparency of processes and broadening engagement with stakeholders.

<p>
There are also many steps that can be taken to minimise risk, such as carefully considering what data needs to be collected and retained and perhaps using anonymisation techniques to remove the risks from handling personal data.
