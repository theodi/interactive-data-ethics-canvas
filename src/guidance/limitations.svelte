  It is rare that data will be collected in a way that covers all demographics equitably and thus there are always likely to be limitations and biases in the data. Even in carefully controlled experiments it is difficult to eliminate all bias. Other aspects such as gaps, omissions or quality problems can also limit the potential of data and increase risks.

      Although data may be adequately managed, this doesnâ€™t mean it is free from errors that increase risk. This module looks at common errors in data and techniques to fix them.
