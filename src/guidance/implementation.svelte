<p>During your project, different social, environmental or economic factors might influence the ethical considerations that you need to focus on. This means that your approach to data ethics needs to be an ongoing process. </p>

  <p>To help ensure that data ethics remains at the core of your project work, consider what measures you can put in place to support the process. These might be fixed-term measures that last for the duration of your project, but that might also be adopted at scale to help your organisation to take a more consistent and structured approach to data ethics practices in the long term. </p>
  
  <p>Use this section to explore what measures you might put in place to support the ongoing implementation of data ethics in your work.

        When it comes to sharing or increasing access to data, there is a wide range of different approaches out there and finding the most suitable approach can be tricky. Weâ€™ve created the Data Access Map to help people and organisations explore the various options and navigate this difficult terrain.
