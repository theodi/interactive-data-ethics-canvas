When thinking about the effects, consideration should be paid to societal, environmental and economic impacts. Consideration should also be given to those outside of your immediate ecosystem.

<p>Consider also:</p>
        
<ul>
  <li>people whom the data is about;</li>
  <li>people impacted by its use;</li>
  <li>organisations using the data.</li>
</ul>
