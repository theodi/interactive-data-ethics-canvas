          The <a href="https://theodi.org/article/data-ethics-canvas/" target="_blank">ODI Data Ethics Canvas</a>
          is a tool for anyone who collects, shares or uses data. It helps identify and manage ethical issues –
          at the start of a project that uses data, and throughout. It encourages you to ask important questions
          about projects that use data, and reflect on the responses. These might be:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>What is your primary purpose for using data in this project?</li>
          <li>Who could be negatively affected by this project?</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          The Data Ethics Canvas provides a framework to develop ethical guidance that suits any context, whatever
          the project’s size or scope.
